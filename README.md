# Machine-Learning

Project 1: Getting familiar with Python basics and exploring how geometry (eg: distances, areas) 
changes in higher dimensional space.

Project 2: Creating preprocessors, learners (cross validation + hyper-parameter tuning), and evaluators. 

Project 3: Getting our hands dirty with scikit-learn. 
Part 1: Using different classifiers to create decision boundaries. Worked with MNIST Digit dataset 
in addition to cancer diagnosis data set. Part 2: Working with precision and recall. 
Challenge: customized my own binary distribution on which one classifier would outperform the rest.

Project 4: Class-wide Kaggle competition.

Competition description: Given a dataset of anonymized user data from a fake social media platform, 
learn a model to be able to predict a user's location (latitude and longitude).

Data given: user IDs, the first, second, and third most common hours they post on the platform, 
the number of times they've posted, latitude + longitude (for training data set), 
and a graph of connections between "friends" on the platform.

Result: My partner and I placed 7th out of 30 participants, with a root mean squared error of ~ 34.31 (the best score was 30.98).
